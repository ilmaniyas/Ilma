  <h2>About Us Page</h2>
  
  <p1>Do you believe that a book can change your life?<br>
 
In 2015, Ilma Niyas (Chief Bookaholic) accidentally landed on a book called The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss. This book led him to start a blog. That blog led him to start an online bookstore.
 
That bookstore is called Hiddenbooks.lk
 
So what do you think? Do you think a book can change your life?<br>
 
We definitely think so.<br><br>
 
We are on a mission to bring down the world’s best books that can change your life. 
 
Our book collection is curated by a Bookaholic who is ready to eat books if that’ll change his life. That’s how much we believe in the power of books.<br>
 
Happy reading!<br><br>
 
P.S. Our customers love us. We’re not even kidding!<br>
 
P.P.S. We also believe that bookmarks can change your life too. You’ll know what we mean when you buy your first book!</p1>
